 Soft, chewy, and loaded with chocolate chips, these classic chocolate chip cookies are a beloved treat perfect for any occasion.

Ingredients:

1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Instructions:

Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Mix Wet Ingredients: In a large bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.
Combine Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
Mix Everything Together: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.
Shape and Bake: Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers will be soft.
Cool and Enjoy: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
