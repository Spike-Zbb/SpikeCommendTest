Description: 

These creamy and tangy cheesecake bars are flavored with lemon and dotted with fresh blueberries, making for a refreshing and delightful dessert.

Ingredients:

For the Crust:

1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
For the Cheesecake Filling:

16 oz (450g) cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup lemon juice (freshly squeezed)
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 cup fresh blueberries (or frozen, thawed and drained)

Instructions:

Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C) and line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang for easy removal.
Prepare the Crust: In a medium bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. Press the mixture evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan.
Prepare the Filling: In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add the sugar and continue beating until creamy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the sour cream, lemon juice, and lemon zest until combined.
Add Blueberries: Gently fold in the blueberries, being careful not to crush them.
Bake: Pour the cheesecake filling over the prepared crust and spread it evenly. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly.
Cool and Chill: Allow the cheesecake bars to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to set. Cut into squares before serving.
