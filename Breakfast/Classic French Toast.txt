Description: 

A delightful and easy breakfast dish with crispy, golden-brown toast coated in a sweet, eggy mixture, perfect for a cozy morning.

Ingredients:

4 slices of bread (preferably thick-cut, like brioche or challah)
2 large eggs
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup heavy cream
1 tbsp sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
Butter for frying
Maple syrup and powdered sugar for serving (optional)

Instructions:

In a shallow dish, whisk together the eggs, milk, cream, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon.
Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat and add a small amount of butter.
Dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture, making sure to coat both sides evenly.
Place the coated bread slices onto the skillet and cook until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side.
Serve warm with maple syrup and a dusting of powdered sugar if desired.
