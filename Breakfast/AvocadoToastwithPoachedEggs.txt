Description: 

A nutritious and delicious breakfast featuring creamy avocado spread on whole-grain toast, topped with a perfectly poached egg.

Ingredients:

2 slices of whole-grain bread
2 large eggs
1 tablespoon white vinegar
Salt and pepper to taste
Red pepper flakes (optional)
Lemon juice (optional)

Instructions:

Toast the Bread: Toast the whole-grain bread slices to your desired level of crispiness.
Prepare the Avocado: Cut the avocado in half, remove the pit, and scoop the flesh into a bowl. Mash with a fork and season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice if desired.
Poach the Eggs: Bring a pot of water to a simmer and add the white vinegar. Crack one egg into a small bowl, then gently slide it into the simmering water. Poach for about 3 minutes for a runny yolk or longer if you prefer firmer yolks. Repeat with the second egg.
Assemble: Spread the mashed avocado evenly over the toasted bread. Top each slice with a poached egg. Season with additional salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes if desired.
Serve: Enjoy immediately while the toast is crispy and the egg is warm.
