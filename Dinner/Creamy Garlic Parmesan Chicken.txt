Description: 

A rich and flavorful chicken dish featuring a creamy garlic parmesan sauce. Perfect for a comforting and hearty dinner.

Ingredients:

4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 tbsp olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup heavy cream
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1/2 tsp dried basil
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)


Instructions:

Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook for 6-7 minutes per side, or until cooked through and golden brown. Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside.
In the same skillet, add minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant.
Add heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, thyme, and basil to the skillet. Stir continuously until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth.
Return the chicken breasts to the skillet, spooning the sauce over them. Simmer for 2-3 minutes to ensure the chicken is heated through and coated with the sauce.
Garnish with chopped parsley and serve with your choice of side dishes, such as rice or pasta.
